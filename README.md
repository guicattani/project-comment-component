## Project Comment Component

## Caveats
This code is supposed to be easily reviewed and was created without Rails boilerplate (using `--minimal`), therefore if this was to be a serious application we'd need [improvements](#improvements)

## Improvements
- Restate modern Rails security guidelines
  - e.g. having `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb`
- Improve accessibility/usage with i18n/locale support
- Use Rails awesome PWA support (Improved for Rails 8)
- Use [https://brakemanscanner.org/]

#### Disclaimer
This project was written without any AI assistance. Instead, to write it faster, I leaned heavily on Rails Generators and Scaffolds
